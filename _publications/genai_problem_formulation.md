Abstract: Generative AI is increasingly competing with question and answer (Q&A) communities due to its proficiency in solving specialized problems. However, empirical evidence is lacking on how generative AI influences users’ problem formulation in Q&A communities. Further, it is unclear what types of problems still remain challenging for generative AI. Motivated by generative AI’s limitations, we examine structural differences in impacts across problems varying on novelty and routineness. We conduct a DID analysis leveraging ChatGPT launch, comparing changes in problem formulation on Stack Overflow between developers more likely to adopt ChatGPT versus a control group. We find that ChatGPT launch reduces developers’ problem posts on Stack Overflow, yet this substitution effect is absent for novel and non-routine problems. Theoretical and practical contributions are discussed regarding generative AI’s differential impacts and the continued importance of Q&A communities despite AI’s rise.
