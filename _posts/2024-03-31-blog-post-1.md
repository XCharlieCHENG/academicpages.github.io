Acknowledge on PhD dissertation gets published (or archived) and lasts forever. Yet those who helped me land on my PhD are equally important and worth something that lasts. So I started this very personal post. My hope is that I can write (a few of) those who encouraged me, challenged me, helped me, and in the mean time document how I decided on pursuing a PhD in Information Systems. If anyone someday finds this post in any sense helpful, that is a plus.
